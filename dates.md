Depending on attendance, we will either run 2 or 3 groups at our discretion.

### Mentorship Program

To allow newer riders to get the most out of their trackday experience, we are implementing a mentorship program. This allows you to ride in sessions below the group you registered in if you have a friend you are helping out with lines/technique.

If you are riding in a session below the one you've registered in, you absolutely MUST respect the riders in that session and the corresponding passing rules. Please confirm with the marshalls prior to entering the track to make sure that there is enough room for you to join in.

### Rain Policy

In the event that the forecast is showing a strong chance of rain, we will open a poll for those that have pre-registered for that day.

If the majority vote in favor of running the day, the day will be run as normal.

If majority vote against, that day will be cancelled and full refunds will be issued to those who have pre-registered

The decision on whether or not the day will run will be announced on our Facebook page 48 hours before the event. Those that have pre-registered will also receive emails to let them know of this update.

## Location

Located at **70292 Grand Bend Line, Grand Bend, Ontario**

KW Sport Racing is ran exclusively at Grand Bend Motorplex (Grand Bend Raceway). The excellent facility and multiple track layouts make it very welcoming and is a key factor to our decision of renting the track.

Layout is decided by poll sent to members that have pre-registered. It will then be updated on the site at the top of this page; usually 5-6 days before the event.
